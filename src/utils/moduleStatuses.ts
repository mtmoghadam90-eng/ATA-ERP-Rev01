/**
 * The status words each module actually uses, as runtime lists.
 *
 * They existed only as type unions, which the workflow rule editor could not
 * read — so its dropdowns were hand-typed beside them and drifted. The purchase
 * order's list there was «در انتظار تأیید / تأیید شده / ارسال شده», three words
 * this application has never stored; the project's was four words none of which
 * exist; the delivery's was seven where the engine emits two. A condition on
 * any of them matched nothing, silently, and the rule simply never ran.
 *
 * So each list lives here once and both sides read it: the module that stores
 * the status, and `src/utils/workflowTriggers.ts` that offers it. Each is
 * pinned to its own type union at **compile time**, in both directions — a
 * status added to the union and not to the list fails `npm run lint`, which is
 * what stops this drifting again the next time a status is added.

 * The day a consignment was delivered, when its lines were delivered one by one.

 * delivered» reads the header: `deliveryWorkflowStatus`, the project stage, and
 * the `delivery_actual` schedule subject, which can only count from a stored
 * column. So «یک ماه پس از تحویل کالا، بپرس نصب چطور پیش رفت» **silently never
 * fired** for such a consignment, and the grid reported «در حال آماده‌سازی»
 * about goods the customer had had for a month.
 *
 * Two decisions, and both are about which record is the more trustworthy.
 *
 * **The last line, not the first.** The customer has the consignment only once
 * the final piece arrives, and asking about installation before that is asking
 * about something they cannot have done — so this answers the *latest* date, and
 * only when **every** line carries one. A part-delivered consignment is not
 * delivered, and reading «any line has a date» would start the month from the
 * first box.
 *
 * **A date somebody typed on the header always wins.** It may be the official
 * handover date while the lines record when each box physically turned up, and
 * overwriting that would change a date the company has told the customer. So the
 * lines only ever *fill in* an empty header — which is precisely the case that
 * was broken — and never correct or clear one. A line's date removed afterwards
 * therefore leaves the header as it was: the consignment *was* delivered, and
 * somebody editing that history is not a reason to report it as undelivered.
